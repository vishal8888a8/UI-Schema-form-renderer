# UI-Schema to Form

It is a React application that will allow users to paste a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application will have a single screen which will be divided into two equal sections next to each other. On the left section will be a JSON editor to paste the UI-Schema. On the right section, a form will be automatically rendered based on the pasted UI-Schema.
